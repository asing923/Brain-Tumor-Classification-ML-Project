# Brain Tumor Classification using Transfer Learning:

Brain tumors present significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment, impacting individuals of all ages. They constitute a significant portion of primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors, including gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary tumors. Early and precise detection plays a vital role in improving patient prognosis and survival rates. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) serves as the preferred diagnostic tool, but manual interpretation of complex image data can be error-prone. This Project proposes an automated brain tumor detection system using deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning with the VGG-16 model. The aim is to achieve faster and more accurate tumor classification, benefiting regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals. Through curated datasets, preprocessing techniques, and model optimization, this project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in enhancing brain tumor diagnosis globally.

## Tech Stack:

- Python: Programming language for implementing the deep learning model and related functionalities.
- Keras: Deep learning frameworks for building and training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
- Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained models for brain tumor classification.
- CNN: Architecture for feature extraction and classification of brain tumor images.
- Hyperparameter Optimization: Fine-tuning model parameters for optimal performance.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model competency.
- Cross-Validation: Technique to validate model performance and prevent overfitting.
- Image Processing: Preprocessing techniques for enhancing brain tumor images.

This project uses a Deep CNN model with transfer learning for brain tumor classification. It includes input, hidden, and output layers, with convolution layers in the hidden layers. Hyperparameters will be optimized for better performance. Transfer learning saves training time. The project evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation prevents overfitting. Python and TensorFlow/Keras are used for implementation. Image processing techniques enhance brain tumor images.
