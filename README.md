# Brain Tumor Classification Project

In this project, we are using a Deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based model with transfer learning approach for brain tumor classification. The model comprises of input, hidden and output layers, with the hidden layers comprising of convolution layers. We will fine-tune the hyperparameters of these layers to optimize the performance of the model.

Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models that have been trained on large datasets, saving us time and effort in training the model from scratch. The final outcome of the project will be accuracy metrics that determine the competency of the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

We will also use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data. This project aims to provide an accurate and efficient solution for the classification of brain tumors.
